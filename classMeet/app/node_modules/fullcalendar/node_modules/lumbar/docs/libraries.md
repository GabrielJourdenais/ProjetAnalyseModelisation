# Libraries

Libraries provide abstractions that allow lumbar components to be bundled into sharable, reusable components. The are able to extend almost any aspect of the lumbar configuration, from setting global config values up to defining entire reusable modules.

## Creating Libraries

Libraries consist of a *lumbar.json* configuration file with at minimum a `name` field which uniquely identifies the library within the current project. This is the human readable method of referencing this library in case of conflicts. (See [Handling Conficts](#handling-conflicts) below for more information on conflicts.

    {
      "name": "my-library"
    }

With the base in we now want to add functionality to this. Generally this is going to be a combination of global settings for the project and mixins that can be loaded at specific points in the project.

### Mixins

A library's mixins are generally implement their primary functionality. They allow for the addition of arbitrary behaviors to a specific module. At the most basic level a mixin can apply any attribute value to a module including additional file references.

For example a mixin that may be used to bootstrap a project:

    "mixins": {
      "core-lib": {
        "scripts": [
          {"src": "js/lib/backbone.queryparams.js", "global": true},
          {"src": "js/lib/backbone.historytracker.js", "global": true},
          {"src": "js/lib/fastclick.js", "global": true},

          {"src": "lumbar-loader-backbone.js", "library": "lumbar-loader", "platform": "web"},

          {"package-config": true},
          {"stylus-config": true},

          {"src": "js/init.js"}
        ],
        "styles": [
          "styles/reset.styl",
          "styles/normalize.styl",
          "styles/tap-highlight.styl"
        ]
      }
    }

In general you would define the contents of a mixin in the same manner as the contents of a normal module, with a few alterations to the behaviors.

All mixin source files are output first in the resulting module. Exception for script files which are marked as global. In that case the files will be output as follows:

> [mixin globals, module globals, mixin locals, module locals]

All file references in the mixin are relative to the library unless explicitly listed in the reference. In the example above, *js/init.js* refers to *libraryDir/js/init.js* at build time. Effectively mixins have their own form of a sandboxed file system. Clients may override portions of this behavior, which is discussed [below](#overriding-files).


### Modules

Libraries may also define entire modules, useful for utility modules such as the generic loader behavior:

    "modules": {
      "loader": {
        "topLevelName": "Loader",
        "mixins": [
          {"name": "lumbar-loader", "env": "dev"},
          {"name": "lumbar-localstorage-loader", "env": "production"}
        ],
        "scripts": [
          "js/load.js"
        ]
      }
    }

Note that any modules defined in a library are automatically accessible as mixins. As a consequence of this, mixins and modules may not have the same name in a given library.

### Global settings

Libraries are able to provide default values for settings that otherwise would be duplicated across projects. For example the Thorax library [defines](https://github.com/walmartlabs/thorax/blob/master/lumbar.json#L73) the template handler that it expects for all projects that import the library.

    "templates": {
      "template": "Handlebars.templates['{{{without-extension name}}}'] = {{handlebarsCall}}({{{data}}});"
    }

The default behavior for global settings is to extend the current project exactly as if the `_.extend` operation occurred. Individual plugins will modify this behavior based on what makes sense. The majority of these cases will be to augment rather than replace behavior, as is the case with the root `template` setting in the example above. Please consult the documentation for each plugin to see the expected behavior for global setting changes.
